# myWebsite
In this project I have created a local server running on port:5000 using Express with Node.js.

The aim of the project is to authenticate the user, by requesting the user to input the correct password.
When the user is authorized, the program will grant the user access to my personal website, which is still being updated.

The project was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.

To start the program:
* open the terminal in your editor
* cd to the folder where you have saved the project on your PC
* initialise NPM
* install the body-parser and express packages ( npm i body-parser express)
* Start the server (node index.js)

In your browser go to "localhost:5000"
